# iterative methods for root finding
 
The values of x that satisfy the equation are called solutions of the equation, and roots or zeros of the expression on its left-hand side.

There are many different root finding techniques. I have created program for some of the common ones like Newton Raphson method, Bisection method, False postion method, Secant method & gradient descent method.

These all methods are called iterative methods.

Iterative methods are the ones which uses an initial guess to generate a sequence of improving approximate solutions using the previous solutions.
